In this article, we will explore some of the main features and functions of Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2018.0.2 (x64) FULL 64 Bit in more detail.
 
## Surfaces
 
Surfaces are one of the most important elements in civil engineering design, as they represent the shape and elevation of the terrain. Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2018.0.2 (x64) FULL 64 Bit provides tools for creating and editing surfaces from various data sources, such as points, contours, breaklines, boundaries, DEM files, and more. Users can also apply surface analysis tools to display slope, aspect, elevation, contours, and other properties of the surface.
 
## Alignments
 
Alignments are linear features that define the horizontal geometry of roads, railways, pipelines, and other civil engineering projects. Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2018.0.2 (x64) FULL 64 Bit allows users to create and modify alignments using various methods, such as fixed or floating tangents, curves, spirals, best fit, and more. Users can also assign design criteria and standards to alignments to check for errors and warnings.
 
## Profiles
 
Profiles are vertical features that define the elevation and grade of alignments. Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2018.0.2 (x64) FULL 64 Bit enables users to create and edit profiles from existing surfaces or alignments, or from scratch using various drawing tools. Users can also apply design criteria and standards to profiles to check for errors and warnings.
 
## Corridors
 
Corridors are three-dimensional features that represent the cross-sectional shape and configuration of roads, railways, tunnels, and other civil engineering projects. Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D 2018.0.2 (x64) FULL 64 Bit allows users to create and edit corridors using assemblies, subassemblies, regions, targets, frequency, and more. Users can also generate cross sections, quantities, surfaces, solids, and other outputs from corridors.
